# Welcome to the FlashNote App iOS Project!

This project is an illinois, Elk Grove High School Computer Science Competition Project!

A little bit to know about the App:
A Note Cards app that helps you organize your Notes for speeches and other things like memorization, it has the ability to add and remove notes, as well as rename them and of course reorganize them in folders with names so you can keep track of your work!
